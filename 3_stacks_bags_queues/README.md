# Bags, Queues, and Stacks

Several fundamental data types invovle collections of objects, and the operations revolving around adding, removing, or examining objects in the collection. For this we consider the bag, the stack, and the queue.

## APIs

We begin by defining the APIs bags, stacks and queues.

Each contains a no-argument constructor, a method to add an item to the collection, a method to test whether the collection is empty, and a method that returns the size of the collection. Stack and Queue each have a method to remove a particular item from the collection.

>In the book, the APIs implement the *Iterable* class(?), seems to be either not needed in python, or it needs the use of *sequence*. Will update in future.

The implementations are found:
